# CodeNote

CodeNote is an advanced GUI-based note-taking application designed for developers. It allows users to create notes with multiple files, each having its own file extension (e.g., .html, .css, .js). Notes and files are stored in the browser's localStorage for easy access and management.

## Features

**Create Notes**: Users can create new notes by providing a unique name.

**Add Files**: Each note can include multiple files with extensions (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js).

**Edit Files**: Add, update, or delete files within a note.

**View Notes**: Open and view saved notes and their associated files.

**Save Notes**: All notes and files are automatically saved in localStorage for persistence.
